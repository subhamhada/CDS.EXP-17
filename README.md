# EXPERIMENT - 17

## Aim :
To study and implement Linked List

## Software :
Vs Code 

## Theory :
- *LINKED LIST :*
A linked list is a dynamic data structure made up of nodes, each containing data and a reference to the next node. It allows efficient insertions and deletions without needing to shift elements, unlike arrays.<BR> Common types include singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists.

### Types Of Linked List :
- *Singly Linked List* : This type consists of nodes where each node points to the next one, allowing only forward traversal. It is useful for simple lists where reverse traversal is not required.
- *Doubly Linked List* : This type features nodes with pointers to both the next and previous nodes, enabling traversal in both directions. It is ideal for scenarios that require frequent navigation forwards and backwards.
- *Circular Linked List* : In this structure, the last node points back to the first node, creating a circular arrangement. It allows for indefinite traversal and is useful for applications like circular queues and round-robin scheduling.

### Basic Operations For Linked List :
#### 1. Insertion :
- *At the Beginning* : New node becomes the head.
- *At the End* : New node is added after the last node.
- *At a Specific Position* : Insert after a specified node.
